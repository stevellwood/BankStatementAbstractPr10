The bank statement


This assignment is to create a monthly bank statement with a list of all the accounts listing one per line and displaying:

Indicator whether the account is a Savings or Checking account ('A' or 'C')
Account number (i.e. 100)
Description
Balance in the account propertly formatted (i.e. 4000.00)
Last check number [if the account is a Checking account] OR
Interest rate [if the account is a Savings account]
It would look something like this:

T Act Description                  Bal    Chk  Rate
= === ============================ ====== ===  ====
S 110 Savings A                    500.00      2.50
C 120 Checking B                   400.00 100 
S 130 Savings C                    800.00      1.50
C 140 Checking D                   200.00 230
To generate this report, you'll need to execute the following lines in your Mainline class file:

Savings savings1 = new Savings();
savings.setDescription("Savings A");
savings.deposit(500.00);
savings.setIntRate(0.025);

Checking checking2 = new Checking();
checking2.setDescription("Checking B");
checking2.setLastCheckNbr(100);
checking2.deposit(400.00);

Savings savings3 = new Savings();
savings3.setDescription("Savings C");
savings3.deposit(800.00);
savings3.setIntRate(0.015);

Checking checking4 = new Checking();
checking4.setDescription("Checking D");
checking4.setLastCheckNbr(230);
checking4.deposit(200.00);

ArrayList<Account> accounts = new ArrayList<Account>();
accounts.add(savings1);
accounts.add(checking2)
accounts.add(savings3);
accounts.add(checking4)

//
// print headers here 
//
for(Account account : accounts) {
    System.out.println(account.print());
}
You need to create at least one JUnit test for your project. You probably have some tests for the getters & setters along with deposit, withdraw, and transferFrom methods. If you don't have any tests for the print() methods in Account and Savings, this might be a good opportunity to do so.

Details

For this assignment, you need to create a new project. You can copy the Account.java, Savings.java into the new project and just make any changes you need.

Project name: TheBankStatement
Package name: ssa
When you're done with your code, create a new repository for your project and in GitHub and push your project up to GitHub. Then provide the URL in the assignment.
